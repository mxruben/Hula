*make getRegion take in 2 positions instead of a position with dimensions?
__tostring for grids and other collections
*have some way to use region() in grids to reference and mutate the grid again
use lazy iterators for Grid iterators to make them more readable and type-checkable

*figure out what do do when poppable collections are empty when popped
make PriorityQueue pop and peek return a {value: T, priority: number} to make it consistent with WeightedArray
*implement peek on all poppable collections (actually implemented front() and back(), more useful)
*maybe reimplement __iter on poppables
figure out how to type SortedArray

*use table.sort for SortedArray? YES! about 1000x faster sort
just probably redo PriorityQueue since I just chatgpted it to begin with

-- Probably don't do the two below. Might want to make everything return references (when the values are tables) and provide functions for copying
make fromData copy data instead of reference
make Grid2D and Grid3D region copy data in different ways depending on if deep or shallow table

add fromData to more data structures where it makes sense

add an optional index parameter to insert functions
make __len metamethod not be a function and just be a reference to the value????
remove sortedarray? Unescessary?
