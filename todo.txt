*make getRegion take in 2 positions instead of a position with dimensions?
__tostring for grids and other collections
*have some way to use region() in grids to reference and mutate the grid again
use lazy iterators for Grid iterators to make them more readable and type-checkable

*figure out what do do when poppable collections are empty when popped
make PriorityQueue pop and peek return a {value: T, priority: number} to make it consistent with WeightedArray
*implement peek on all poppable collections (actually implemented front() and back(), more useful)
*maybe reimplement __iter on poppables
figure out how to type SortedArray

use table.sort for SortedArray?
just probably redo PriorityQueue since I just chatgpted it to begin with

add fromData to more data structures where it makes sense
